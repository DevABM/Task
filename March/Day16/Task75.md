# Day 75 - Sending Docker Log to Grafana

We have monitored ,😉 that you guys are understanding and doing amazing with monitoring tool. 👌


Today, make it little bit more complex but interesting 😍 and let's add one more **Project** 🔥 to your resume.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Task:

- Install *Docker* and start docker service on a Linux EC2 through [USER DATA](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/0999394e87192863b5c190a90896249c31ce31af/2023/day39/tasks.md) .
- Create 2 Docker containers and run any basic application on those containers (A simple todo app will work).
- Now intregrate the docker containers and share the real time logs with Grafana (Your Instance should be connected to Grafana and Docker plugin should be enabled on grafana).
- Check the logs or docker container name on Grafana UI.
