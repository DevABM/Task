<h1>Day 5 Task: Advanced Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps Engineers with User management</h1>
<p>
If you noticed that there are total 90 sub directories in the directory '2023' of this repository. What did you think, how did I create 90 directories. Manually one by one or using a script, or a command ?
</p><p>
All 90 directories within seconds using a simple command.
</p><p>
 mkdir day{1..90}
</p>

You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -
</p><p>
So Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that when the script is executed with three given arguments (one is directory name and second is start number of directories and third is the end number of directories ) it creates specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.
</p><p>
Example 1: When the script is executed as<br>
r file that holds the scheduling information.<br>
r file that holds the scheduling information.<br>
r file that holds the scheduling information.<br>

Read about User Management and Let me know on Linkedin if you're ready for Day 6.
A user is an entity, in a Linux operating system, that can manipulate files and perform several other operations. Each user is assigned an ID that is unique for each user in the operating system. In this post, we will learn about users and commands which are used to get information about the users. After installation of the operating system, the ID 0 is assigned to the root user and the IDs 1 to 999 (both inclusive) are assigned to the system users and hence the ids for local user begins from 1000 onwards.

Create 2 users and just display their Usernames
