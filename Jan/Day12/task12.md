## Finally!! ðŸŽ‰
You have completed the Linux & Git-GitHub handson and I hope you have learned something interesting from it.ðŸ™Œ

Now why not make an interesting ðŸ˜‰ assignment, which  not only will help you for the future but also for the DevOps Community!

Letâ€™s make a well articulated and documented **"cheat-sheet"** with all the commands you learned so far in Linux, Git-GitHub and brief info about its usage.

Letâ€™s  show us your knowledge mixed with your creativityðŸ˜Ž

*I have added a [Linux cheatsheet](https://www.loggly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Linux-Cheat-Sheet-Sponsored-By-Loggly.pdf) and [GitHub Cheatsheet](Jan/Day12/Git-Cheat-Sheet.pdf)for your reference, Make sure every cheatsheet must be UNIQUE*

Post it on Linkedin and Spread the knowledge.ðŸ˜ƒ 

**Happy Learning :)**
