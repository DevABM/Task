## Finally!! 🎉
You have completed the Linux & Git-GitHub handson and I hope you have learned something interesting from it.🙌

Now why not make an interesting 😉 assignment, which  not only will help you for the future but also for the DevOps Community!

Let’s make a well articulated and documented **"cheat-sheet"** with all the commands you learned so far in Linux, Git-GitHub and brief info about its usage.

Let’s  show us your knowledge mixed with your creativity😎

*I have added a [Linux cheatsheet](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/LinuxCommandLineCheatSheet.pdf) and [GitHub Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)for your reference, Make sure every cheatsheet must be UNIQUE*

Post it on Linkedin and Spread the knowledge.😃 

**Happy Learning :)**
