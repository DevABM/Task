You have completed the Linux & Git-GitHub handson and I hope you have learned something interesting from it.ðŸ™Œ

Now why not make an interesting ðŸ˜‰ assignment, which  not only will help you for the future but also for the DevOps Community!

Letâ€™s make a well articulated and documented **"cheat-sheet"** with all the commands you learned so far in Linux, Git-GitHub and brief info about its usage.

Letâ€™s  show us your knowledge mixed with your creativityðŸ˜Ž

*I have added a [cheatsheet](https://www.sqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SQL-Cheat-Sheet-2.png) for your reference, Make sure every cheatsheet must be UNIQUE*
